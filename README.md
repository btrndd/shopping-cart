# Shopping Cart

Hey there!

On this project, I was able to:

- Make API (Application Programming Interface) requests;
- Manipulating DOM;
- Manipulating HTML;
- Manipulating JavaScript;
- Manipulating CSS;
- Work with ASYNC Functions!

The Shopping Cart is totally dinamic and consumes all the data straight from the Mercado Livre'stm API!
Let me know what you think about it!
